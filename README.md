Angular Developer Test
======================
The Business of Fashion uses various tests to assess whether a candidate is best suited to the expectations of the role advertised and the offer given.

This test aims to demonstrate your technical skills in practice: that you can deliver a solution which implements a scalable front-end architecture, which is easy to use, and that pays attention to the requirement details.

Instructions & Deliverables
---------------------------

1. Fork this repository to your account (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Read these instructions carefully first before continuing with the practical test
3. Read the Requirements / Story Definition and Conditions of Acceptance
4. Identify and write at least 5 test cases (no code necessary; Gherkin or a written list will suffice)
    - Demonstrate your understanding of the Conditions of Acceptance
    - Identify any appropriate edge cases
5. Implement the Story's functionality using the files in 'public' directory
    - Develop a solution which demonstrates your skills and strengths
    - You may add/change/modify any files in the project
    - You may use any google or other references for angular/bootstrap syntax
6. Describe how you can build a better "Product" for this coding task in SOLUTION.md and include your estimates
7. Create a pull request to origin repository when you are satisfied with your solution (https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) 


Other Notes
-----------

- This test uses Angular 1.5 and Bootstrap 3 but you are free to base it on Angular 1.6 and/or Foundation if that is what you prefer
- Please remember to demonstrate your skills and how you would normally approach feature development
- I must ask that you time yourself so that you balance Quality and Delivery. I will not prescribe a
deadline of X hours, instead, I would like you estimate the task, complete the task, and measure your elapsed time. Please submit your estimate and actual time with your code solution
- Solution should be fully working when we check out code, make sure you add any additional dependencies you use in package.json or bower.json
- You can access API docs here: (https://github.com/bof-ci/test-angular/blob/master/API_DOCS.md)
